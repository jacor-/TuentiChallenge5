# TuentiChallenge5
Some of the solutions proposed for the TuentiChallenge5. I do not know yet it the solutions are the good ones or not (just tested on the private test). The code might not be well commented or structured at all (comptetitive programming... sometimes you just want to be fast) but you can use this code to make an idea about how to solve a specific problem.
