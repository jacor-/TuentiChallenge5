# TuentiChallenge5

These are the solutions I proposed for the challenges of #TuentiChallenge5.

This challenge combines classical algorithmics problems with non so common problems related to Cryptography, S.O. vulnerabilities, front and backend web reverse engineering and even assembler (I still have neighmares when I remember the Forth problem and the Gragol code written in russian!!!). 

If you feel curious about the contest, take a look at the challenges at https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges. I suggest you to think the solution of the challenges by yourself... once you reach the solution everything becomes very obvious and straightforward but this contest is interesting precisely because many times (actually almost all the time) you must thing out of the box and figure out what the hell are you supposed to do.

This is the third year I participate and I have gotten my best results this year (11th in the final rank this year, 18th and 49th the previous two years) and I have to admit that this contest has helped a lot to start learning a bit about many fields I just didn't know they existed. I absolutely recommend this contest to anyone who likes informatics in general and who can just stop its world for a week (this contest is very, very, very time consuming). 

The solutions I propose are implemented in Python (my refference language) and are a bit commented here and there. Said this: the code is not as well structured as I would like and the comments are not as good as they should. Anyway, I post the codes just to share my proposals with other contestants/curious who might have got stucked in a problem.

The problems 5,6 and 7 didn't pass the test phase of the contest! There is probablya little bug... if you find it, feel free to update the repo!

If you disagree with some of the solutions, you have a better one and you want to share it or you have solved the problems I didn't have time to: just contact me!
